The following modifications to the file-system are required when
installing ACK under UniSoft Unix:

1) Create a writable directory /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/tmp (if not present already)
     mkdir /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/tmp
     chmod 777 /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/tmp
2) Install the file "assert.h" in /usr/include (this file is not
   included in the Unisoft distribution, although it is standard V7 Unix).
   The file can be copied from the ACK-tree:
     cp /usr/em/include/assert.h /usr/include

The UniSoft C compiler we used contains a bug that will cause
incorrect translations of the files getline.c and putline.c in
the directory util/opt (which contains the EM Peephole Optimizer).
To get around this bug, act as follows (after having compiled
the entire kit):
	1) compile the files getline.c and putline.c by hand to assembly code
	   (cc -S getline.c putline.c)
	2) edit the files getline.s and putline.s. Look for the instruction:
		   add.l #em_flag+ ....  ,a0
	   which appears TWICE in both files
	   and change it into:
		   add.l #em_flag-1,a0
	3) do cc -c getline.s
	      cc -c putline.s
	   to create new object files getline.o and putline.o
	4) throw away the file "opt" and type make
